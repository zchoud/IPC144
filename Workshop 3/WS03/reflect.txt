IPC144  - Assignment 3

The workshop introduced the pre initialized variable that allows the use of a number that is defined before the main function. Testing different methods of error checking, with the use of loops introduced, I had tested with using a nested loop and using the continue function. Additionally, multiple conditions were used to satisfy different error conditions in loop. Additionally, casting, arithmetic operations and conditions are reinforced for practice. 
When brainstorming the code, I had initially started with a plain English version of the code that was converted into code afterward. This made the code a lot easier to plan and implement than trying to do both figuring out the functions and algorithm simultaneously.
For the iteration a for loop was used where initialization is done along with condition and change in the same line for the loops after the first. To test my solution, I had tested the error on each day, using different numbers in the positive and negative range recording which numbers have been tested. Additionally when entering a number I would use break points to ensure the max and min numbers are correctly assigned along with the days assigned.
