IPC144  - Assignment 4

The workshop introduced and provided practice to the use of arrays as well as the concept of parallel arrays. The use of an array allows the grouping in a set of data of the same type using a single identifier. In using the array, it became clear that using 0 for iteration initialization is a good practice as an array begins at 0 for its counting. In using an index of zero, when looping the first value can be viewed, used, and manipulated easy. Otherwise, when saving values or obtaining the first value would complicating during the indexing. 

In the lab when using an array for highest and lowest temperatures, it can easily be stored in a simple to read method. The other options include the method used last time where the variable is being constantly updated (temporary variable) or the use of multiple variables. Using a temporary value, it would be easier on the memory as only 1 value is stored at a time. However, the array saving the multiple amounts allow for later manipulation if needed. Additionally, when combining with the use of parallel arrays, values can be synchronously indexed for manipulation even if they are different types. 

One method I had used to approach the problem as there were differing steps involved was the use of starting with comments and explain what the goal of the code that should be written is in contrast to the pseudocode that I had tried last workshop. I had found this a lot faster in both working towards the solution than going straight to the code or having to write on separately and allowed the organization of the code.
